### What to focus on

HTTP
What's going on under the hood in Sinatra.
The HTTP request/response cycle and URL parsing.
Stay high-level. So don't focus on Sinatra specifically, but rather consider what a web development framework does.
What is a route?
What is a template?
Get comfortable with the development process. At the end of the course we build up a web-app using this process. We will also add tests.
